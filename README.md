# Blockchain-Based-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project proposes a hybrid framework combining advanced machine learning models and blockchain technology to combat credit card fraud. It integrates CNNs (TensorFlow/Keras) and decision trees for high-accuracy fraud detection, with data preprocessing handled by Pandas, NumPy, and Pickle. Blockchain (Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric) and Solidity smart contracts ensure secure, tamper-proof storage of flagged transactions and automate card blocking for recurring fraud. Utilizing Web3.py, Flask APIs, React frontend, and Flask-CORS, the system enables real-time monitoring, robust fraud detection, and decentralized transparency, offering a scalable solution for financial security.

### Key Points of the Project:

1. **Objective**: Develop a robust, secure, and efficient credit card fraud detection system.

2. **Technology Integration**:
   - **Machine Learning**: Utilizes advanced models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and decision tree ensembles for accurate fraud detection.
   - **Blockchain**: Implements a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger to securely record all transactions, ensuring transparency and accountability.

3. **Real-Time Processing**:
   - Processes transactional data in real time.
   - Uses sophisticated algorithms to predict the likelihood of fraudulent activity.

4. **Data Integrity and Security**:
   - Ensures trust, traceability, and integrity by securely documenting every transaction on the blockchain.
   - Prevents alterations or deletions of transaction records.

5. **Benefits**:
   - Reduces false positives in fraud detection.
   - Enhances fraud detection accuracy.
   - Provides a reliable and comprehensive framework to safeguard financial transactions.

6. **Impact**:
   - Addresses major challenges in financial security.
   - Protects both financial institutions and consumers from the growing threat of credit card fraud.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
